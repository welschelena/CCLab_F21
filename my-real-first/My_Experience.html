<h2>About My Ocean</h2>

<p>I learned to swim pretty much as soon as I was born. My entire family loves the ocean, and it had been hugely integrated into our lives. As you can see from the first picture, even as a little kid, I loved not only the ocean, but any form of swimming. I went scuba diving for the first time at 11, got my first scube license at 15, and my advanced license at 17. The middle picture above, is me at 17, in Fiji where I got my second license. I went on a 2-week long social project, where we taught children, got scuba licenses, did beach cleanings, aquatic research, went on shark dives and planted mangrove trees to protect shark habitats. Every year, there is at least one holiday where you will find my somewhere by the ocean, whethere there is awesome wildlife, cool diving opportunities, huge waves or simply just a good view, I always gravititate towards the water. </p>

<h2>My Coolest Dives</h2>

<h4>Whale Shark Dive</h4>

<p>One of my coolest dives, was in Thailand, where my family and I went swimming with whale sharks. There was a whale shark feeding ground, and guides would take us out into the ocean on little boats. We would just jump into the water off the boat when we were surrounded by the whale sharks. We saw their feeding habits, and got to swim with them. I think often on pictures people forgot just how big these animals are, but when we were with them, only then do you realise how huge and fantastical they are. One of the whale sharks tail's lightly tapped my moms leg as it was swimming by, and it left quite the bruise. It just reminded us that we were in their home, and we shouldn't be too close. I think this was truly a once in a lifetime experience. </p>

<h4>Bull Shark Dive</h4>

<p>Unlike the whale shark dive, my bull shark dive was with actual scuba gear. We were about 30-meters underwater, in a group of about 20 people. The lead divers brought chum (consisting of dead fish with blood to attract the sharks), and we headed underwater and waited on the oceans floor. The sharks then circled around us and curiously swam at us. Unlike common belief, even the "most aggressive sharks" really have no interest in harming people, and are mainly curious. Once in the water, I had no fear of them, and only fascination. If I ever had the chance, I would definitely do it again.
