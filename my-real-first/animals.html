<h2>Whales</h2>

<p>There are 7 types of great whales. Great whales are those of great size, including the gray, humpback, right, blue, sperm, bow- head, fin, sei, Minke, pygmy right, and Bryde's whales. However, there are loads of whales that technically don't belong in the whale category. This would include my two favourite types. Being the whale shark and killer whales otherwise known as orcas. Orcas are technically classified as dolfins, and whale sharks are classified as sharks. Whale sharks are sharks and not whales, because their tials are upright, whales tails are flat and move up and down, while shark tails are upright and move side to side. </p>

<p> Orcas are the other type of whale that isn't technically a whale. While orcas are members of the marine dolphin family Delphinidae, their overall size is what sets them apart from others in their suborder. Today, if a dolphin reaches a size of more than 30 feet long, it may be referred to by some as a whale, but the rules of taxonomy still classify the orca as a dolphin.</p>
